# Next Snake

This is a classic Snake game built using Next.js for the frontend and Firebase for backend services like authentication and high-score storage. The game features a responsive design, user authentication, difficulty levels, sound effects, a leaderboard to track high scores, and uses snake case for all text!

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign in with Google to save your high scores.
- **Responsive Design**: Play the game on both desktop -using the arrow keys- and mobile devices -using buttons on the screen-.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose from 5 difficulty levels to adjust the snake's speed.
- **Sound Effects**: Enjoy sound effects for eating, game over, and game start (can be muted).
- **Leaderboard**: Compete with other players and see the top 10 high scores.
- **Pause/Resume**: Pause the game and resume whenever you want.
- **Mobile Controls**: On-screen controls for mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore)
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, etc.), URL query parameters.
- **Audio**: HTML5 Audio for sound effects
- **Routing**: Next.js routing for navigation

3. **Set up Firebase**:

   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Enable **Google Authentication** and **Firestore** in the project settings
   - Add your Firebase configuration in a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. **Open the app**:
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## How to Play
